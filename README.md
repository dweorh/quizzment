 A simple tool to create quizzes.

## Preface

I've created that tool for my purpose.

I needed a simple tool to learn traffic regulations to pass an exam for category A (motorbikes).

That comes with a few 'issues':

1. Project is small, and I also used it for some code experiments. What you can see is just a snapshot, so the code may look strange sometimes.
2. It supports only two types of questions: 1 of n, or Yes / No.

The code you can find in the 'example' folder is almost what you can find on <https://www.e-prawojazdy.com>

The layout is very simple but mobile friendly as that was the main usage of that tool.

## The 'Example' folder

Questions and related media (due to its size not currently available) were published by the Polish government and were up-to-date in May 2022.

Multimedia there were converted by me to make them web-browser friendly.
